## Description
This is a web tool that allows the filtering of DriveBC Highway Events based on Area and Route. The standard DriveBC events list at [drivebc.ca](https://www.drivebc.ca) doesnâ€™t provide the ability to set a filter for both Area and Route. Currently, the areas supported are Vancouver Island, Lower Mainland, and Thompson-Nicola, however, I plan to add more areas in the future.
